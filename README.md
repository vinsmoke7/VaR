# VaR
VaR and CVaR with monte carlo simulation.
conclusion:
The VaR of -0.03 indicates that with a confidence level of 95%, the maximum potential loss over the specified time horizon (e.g., one day) is $0.03 (or whatever the currency unit is). In other words, there is a 5% chance that the loss will exceed this amount.

The CVaR of -0.04 represents the average loss beyond the VaR threshold. It indicates that if the loss exceeds the VaR level, the average loss would be $0.04. CVaR provides a more comprehensive measure of downside risk compared to VaR, as it considers the tail of the loss distribution beyond the VaR threshold.
